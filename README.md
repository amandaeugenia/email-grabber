# Email Grabber

Email Grabber is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to extract email addresses from text documents effortlessly. Inspired by the work of JosephDembele95, this tool scans the active editor for any email addresses and compiles them into a new text file for easy access. Whether you're gathering contact information or organizing your emails, Email Grabber streamlines the process, making it simple and efficient.
